# URL-in-a-Box
A firefox addon that allows for having a url in a browser action

Created because of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/63czfw/is_there_an_addon_for_embeding_a_webpage_into/) reddit post.   
Set the page to appear in the browser action in the options page. The default is Wikipedia. Some pages might not work well. 

The icon is from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com)
